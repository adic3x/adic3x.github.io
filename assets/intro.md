# Welcome to my blog on programming

If you are reading this on a device other than a phone, there is likely a standard keyboard in front of you. Take a look at it: its design originated over a century ago. According to its layout, you are meant to use ten fingers to type. Your two strongest and most agile fingers, your thumbs - are assigned to press exactly one key: the spacebar. Meanwhile, your two weakest and least coordinated fingers, your pinkies - are responsible for roughly 20 different keys.

This is the complete opposite of a modern gamepad, where thumbs do almost everything, controlling sticks and hitting multiple buttons simultaneously.

Now, imagine if tomorrow someone forced you to use a strange "ergonomic" keyboard. You would curse that person. Your productivity would tank, and your brain would fight every keystroke.

Programming suffers from the same problem. It is filled with bizarre concepts and paradigms. Some were invented half a century ago; the original reasons for others have long been forgotten. But we cannot simply put the entire industry on pause and say, _"We need a decade to invent the right tools and rewrite everything from scratch"_.

The goal of this blog is to critically evaluate the current state of things and try to understand how we can do better. However, every solution is a compromise with its own set of pros and cons, so I welcome your comments.
