Take a look at it: its design originated over a century ago. According to its layout, you are meant to use ten fingers to type. Your two strongest and most agile fingers, your thumbs - are assigned to press exactly one key: the spacebar. Meanwhile, your two weakest and least coordinated fingers, your pinkies - are responsible for roughly 20 different keys.</p><p>This is the complete opposite of a modern gamepad, where thumbs do almost everything, controlling sticks and hitting multiple buttons simultaneously.</p><p>Now, imagine if tomorrow someone forced you to use a strange "ergonomic" keyboard. You would curse that person. Your productivity would tank, and your brain would fight every keystroke.</p><p>Programming suffers from the same problem. It is filled with bizarre concepts and paradigms. Some were invented half a century ago; the original reasons for others have long been forgotten. But we cannot simply put the entire industry on pause and say, <em>"We need a decade to invent the right tools and rewrite everything from scratch"</em>.</p><p>The goal of this blog is to critically evaluate the current state of things and try to understand how we can do better. However, every solution is a compromise with its own set of pros and cons, so I welcome your comments.</p><h1>List of content</h1><ul class="table-of-content"><li><a href="./hello.html">Hello from Rust</a> <time>24 jan 2026</time></li></ul></main><footer>© 2026 adic3x, license: CC BY-NC 4.0<br>Powered by <a href="https://github.com/adic3x/blog_generator">blog_generator</a> & <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></footer></body></html>
